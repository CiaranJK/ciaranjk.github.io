          <p> As a partner in Because Video I improved my customer service, project management and sales skills.  My encompassed all elements of the business – on-set production, post-production, working with clients and sales.  I learned to be both a self-starter and a finisher.  We worked with a wide variety of companies from start-ups to multi-nationals.  One of the most challenging projects I worked for was during the Covid-19 pandemic where I had to edit videos for a large pharmaceutical company called Astra Zeneca.  The videos were geared at health professionals throughout Ireland and were needed within a very tight timeframe.  I was grateful to have the opportunity to take on the work during the pandemic.</p>
