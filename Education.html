          <h3>DCU Business</h3>

          <p>I completed a bachelor of business studies with specialising in finance in DCU in 2015.  The degree enabled me to develop my knowledge of business operations and marketing in particular and helped my hone my analytical skills through the financial aspect of the course.</p>




          <h3>Irish Tax Institute</h3>
          <img  src="Tax Institute.jpg" alt="Irish_Tax_Institute_Logo" width=200px height=auto>

          <p > I pursued the chartered tax advisor course up until part 3 from 2015 to 2018.  It was a challenging course that helped me deepen my knowledge of the areas of taxation and law.  During the course I realised that taxation was not the career path that I was interested in.  I felt I needed something that I found creative and exciting so I decided to not complete the course and to pursue the creative field of video production more seriously.

          <h3>TU Dublin</h3>
          <img  src="TU Dublin Logo.jpg" alt="TU_Dublin_Logo.jpg" width=200px height=auto>

          <p> A master’s course in computing is something I have had in the back of my mind since completing my degree in DCU.  I am very grateful that I have finally took the step to pursue one because I have found my time in TU Dublin to be my most rewarding education experience to date.  The material on the course is exactly what I have been looking for and I now realise that a career in computing is what I want to pursue.  No other career path offers me the opportunity to continually learn and develop my creativity and analytical capacities with the same variety and possibility for growth.  I am delighted to be on this course and it is my hope and expectation to pursue the full masters next year.      </p>
